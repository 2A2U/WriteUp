2 The tool use to analyze the sample (4 marks) 
	tools used: Ghidra, Terminal, strings
3.The behavior of the sample do (2 marks)
assusmpsuion that the file will actually have 2 base64 text that will decoded and put it into variable. However, user who execute the file will only see an output that the file print (after system("clear"))
```C++
std::operator<<((basic_ostream *)std::cout,"Your machine has been infected ;P\n");

From the picture below we can see that the program will lookup utem website then using wget to download a file in the `https://ftmk.utem.edu.my/dfir4/system.file` then the file will be saved to `/var/system.file/system.file.2`.

For the second flag with the same way as the previous file, we need to understand the second base64 text "`L2V0Yy9wYXNzbWU=`". when decoded the text will be like this "`/etc/passme⏎ `" then run the command `strings /etc/passme` we get the second flag which is `flag2_LT`
5.The Two Flag you can get from the sample file.( 2 marks) 
First Flag: `BITS3453<labtest2_flag_one>⏎` 
Second Flag: `flag2_LT
